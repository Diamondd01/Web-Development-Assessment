    <p>This is all about me. I am the second oldest of 5, however, based on how mature I am and the way I take care of my siblings, you would think that I am the oldest. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. It's only fun there for a short vacation. The side of town I lived in wasn't the part that people visited. I spent a few of my teenage years up until now in Georgia. Now I've settled here. I have a boyfriend, I have a dog, and I'm working on developing my career. As a kid, I wanted to be a fashion designer then I moved onto wanting to be a Physician Assistant. Now my desire is to get into tech. Younger me would be shocked and yet so proud. If you've read this far, thank you. You now know more about me than most.</p>
